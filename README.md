# New York Times Spelling Bee Puzzle Solver
Author: Robert Pendergast

## Project Description
Have you ever stared blankly at the screen of the New York Times Spelling Bee game during lecture and had no idea what the words were? Me too!
Instead of figuring out how to solve this fun puzzle, I made an algorithm to do it for me! With this, I have achieved genius levels of intelligence by substituting my own intelligence with a robot.
